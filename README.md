## What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?

I began coding in highschool when I took C++.
I figured Id try it because why not and my dad
encouraged it because he is a software engineer.
I didnt learn much and had to copy to get by
but when I got to Towson it was so easy because
I had seen the code before and the rest was easy
from there.  I picked the major because it was the
only major I didnt hate and I ended up liking it.
I took this class because I have built websites
and UIs in my personal time using all the usual
tools like node/html/css/js/etc but I wanted
to have a structured enviroment to see if there
was anything I could improve upon.

## What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?

My ideal career progression givin no limitations
would probably in the following order

1. Be a Software Engineer working at a company the intersects with my other hobbies
2. Create my own app/program/whatever for something Im interested in
3. Ideally save enough to become finacially independent by 42
4. Consult as a hobby and figure out how to have fun as retired
In the end I would like to keep Computer Science as something that I would like
to do into retirement but more hobby based.

## What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?

I am have expieriance in Java, JavaScript, Bash, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, SQL,
Node, and someother similar things.  I have some web expieriance as listed above
and have made websites for various things and used APIs with them and databases
and what not.  I have never made a fully developed website and that is part
of the reason I took this class.
